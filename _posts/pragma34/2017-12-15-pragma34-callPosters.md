This page is under construction 

All PRAGMA 34 attendees are welcome to submit posters (and associated abstracts)
to the PRAGMA 34 Poster Session, especially students. 
The poster session offers the opportunity for presenters to share their work
through a quick introduction to the entire conference audience, followed by
one-on-one discussions next to the poster.

<div class="border"><h2>Submissions</h2></div>

Authors are expected to both present their poster during poster sessions and
to give a three (3) minute introductory lightning talk. As such, an acceptable
submission must include a PDF of the poster text abstract and will form the basis
for your lightning talk.<br>

The submission should cover the following information: <br>

1. **Title of the poster** 
2. **Names and institutions** 
3. **A brief abstract (less than or equal to 450 words)**

<br>

We strongly recommend all submissions use the word template 
<a href="/images/pragma34/PRAGMA34_Poster_Abstract_Template2.dotx">here</a>.<br>

All posters must use the **A1** format (594 x 841 mm/23.4 x 33.1 in).<br>
All submissions will be reviewed by PRAGMA Students Steering Committee and
decisions will be made available via email. Authors are expected to respond to
review comments and, if necessary, resubmit their updated poster and abstract.<br>
