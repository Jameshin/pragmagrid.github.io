<p><b>Welcome to PRAGMA 34!</b></p>
<p>On behalf of the organizing committee, we would like to welcome everyone to Japan for the 34th meeting of the Pacific Rim Applications and Grid Middleware Assembly (PRAGMA 34). This workshop continues our long-standing effort in cyberinfrastructure research to support the long tail of science, namely small to medium sized distributed groups, to strengthen collaborations and nurture the next generation of scientists.</p>
<p>The theme for the PRAGMA 34 workshop is “AI in Data Connected Communities” and highlights the impact of the global interest in artificial intelligence (AI) for data intensive applications. We also have planned a pre-PRAGMA workshop that will feature talks and a visit to the new ABCI supercomputer in Kashiwa that AIST is building specifically for AI applications and research.</p>
<p>This is the fifth time PRAGMA has met in Japan, but it is the first time for the workshop to be in Tokyo. Being the capital city of Japan, we hope you will enjoy and experience much in the vibrant, dynamic landscape of Tokyo.</p>
<p>Again, welcome back to Japan and we hope that you will enjoy your time here.</p>
