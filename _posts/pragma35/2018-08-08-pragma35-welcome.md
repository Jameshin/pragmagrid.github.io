On behalf of the organizing committee, we would like to welcome everyone to
Japan for the 35th meeting of the Pacific Rim Applications and Grid Middleware
Assembly (PRAGMA 35). This workshop continues our long-standing effort in
cyberinfrastructure research to support the long tail of science, namely small
to medium sized distributed groups, to strengthen collaborations and nurture
the next generation of scientists.

The theme for the PRAGMA 35 workshop is TBA

This is the fifth time PRAGMA has met in Japan, but it is the first time for
the workshop to be in Tokyo. Being the capital city of Japan, we hope you will
enjoy and experience much in the vibrant, dynamic landscape of Tokyo.

Again, welcome back to Japan and we hope that you will enjoy your time here.
