<div class="border35">Welcome to PRAGMA 35!</div>

On behalf of the organizing committee, we would like to welcome everyone to
Malaysia for the 35th meeting of the Pacific Rim Applications and Grid
Middleware Assembly (PRAGMA 35). This workshop continues our long-standing
effort in cyberinfrastructure research to support the long tail of science,
namely small to medium sized distributed groups, to strengthen collaborations
and nurture the next generation of scientists.

The theme for the PRAGMA 35 workshop is <strong>HPC and AI empowering Data Analytics</strong>
and highlights the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and High-Performance
Computing in transforming data analytics landscape. This workshop is
co-located with Big Data Summit 2.

This is the second time PRAGMA has met in Penang, Malaysia after almost a
decade. 

We look forward to seeing you in Penang on the 3rd - 6th October 2018.
