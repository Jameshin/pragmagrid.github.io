  <h4>University of Hyderabad (UoHyd)</h4> 
</div>

<p>The University of Hyderabad (UoHyd) is a founding member of PRAGMA and an initial member of the PRAGMA Steering Committee. 
PRAGMA serves as a mechanism through which information and resources can easily be exchanged. It is playing the catalytic role of 
promoting collaborations. We found that with its participative sessions, PRAGMA encourages people to connect with each other quickly 
and seamlessly. Networking is easier and fruitful partnerships are being initiated in a relatively short time. PRAGMA has a focus and 
a mission to accomplish tasks and test new ideas.
Recent efforts of UoHyd have centered on exchanging students under the PRIME program, which provides undergraduates at UCSD 
with hands-on, full-time research experiences in internationally collaborative settings. Several of our own students have 
benefitted by interacting with them. This has helped us to evolve a very vibrant academic and research group here in our 
department (Computer/Information Sciences) where every year several students register to work on problems related to grid and 
cloud computing. PRAGMA has been providing a great opportunity to connect to the grid research community and landscape of 
cultures as it moves from one location to another.

  <h4>National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)</h4>
</div>
<p>The National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC) is a statutory government organization under the National 
Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA), Ministry of Science and Technology. Our main responsibilities are to undertake, 
support, and promote the development of electronics and computer technologies through research and development activities. 
The range of our applications spans from supporting agriculture, healthcare, ecology and environment, manufacturing and the 
service industry, to bridging the digital divide, cultural preservation, disaster mitigation, and development of R&D human resource. 
We also play role in the development of IT related research infrastructure.</p>

NECTEC has been an active member of PRAGMA since 2002. We have found that the collaboration with PRAGMA is very beneficial 
to our missions. Close relationships with the Resource Working Group have given us good technical support for our computing 
resource setup. This has been one of our strengths in building the computing infrastructure for computational research in Thailand. 
Collaborations within PRAGMA led us to become a member of APGrid PMA, which became a significant component in our development of 
the Thailand National e-Science Infrastructure Consortium. Our development of an environmental information portal called “Environment 
Informatorium” has become part of a GEO Grid collaboration. This is a result of the interaction within the GEO Working Group. 
Participation in PRAGMA’s Telescience Working Group has led to recent collaborations on coral reef monitoring with the Australian 
Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), NCHC, NECTEC, Walailak University (WU), and UCSD. Researchers from collaborating partners and 
a student from PRIME have visited the study site at Racha Island, Southern Thailand; Michael Nekrasov, PRIME 2009, returned there 
to help with setting up the site. The equipment and software system have been set up and the site has already been registered as 
the fourth CREON coral reef site. A paper on this will be presented by the lead author, Professor Mullica of WU at the upcoming 
Environmental Information Management (EIM) conference.*</p>

  <h4>Kasetsart University (KU)</h4> 
</div>

<p>During our engagement in PRAGMA activities, Kasetsart University (KU) has gained many benefits from our interactions. 
First, the experiences in the building of a large international cyberinfrastructure help deepen our understanding of how 
large and complex infrastructure can be built and operated reliably. As we collaborate in building a monitoring infrastructure 
called SCMSWeb, there are many technical challenges that enable us to gain many valuable insights into the monitoring technology. 
Moreover, the exchange of ideas and culture that has happened throughout these years prepares our researchers to be ready to 
work in a new globalized world. We look forward to more future work with PRAGMA members in the move towards large-scale deployment 
of cloud and virtualization technology. This is an exciting transition and will create new potential for many areas of application 
and we hope that we can be a part of this effort.

  <h4>Konkuk University (Konkuk U)</h4> 
</div>

<p>Konkuk University (Konkuk U.) has been participating in PRAGMA since the 3rd PRAGMA workshop in Fukuoka, Japan in 2003 
and officially joined PRAGMA as an institute member during PRAGMA 12. Through both the participation in workshops and a 
number of collaborative efforts together with other members, Konkuk U. has been developing its experiences and strength 
in interdisciplinary research and global collaboration. Based on experiences and lessons from Working Group (WG) activities in 
PRAGMA, Konkuk U. established an interdisciplinary graduate program called the Department of Advanced Technology Fusion in 2006, 
which addresses a wide range of scientific disciplines: information technology, environment technology, biotechnology and intelligent 
microsystems. The program was selected as one of eleven graduate programs of excellence in interdisciplinary science and engineering 
in 2006 and has been financially and administratively supported by the Ministry of Education and Science. Largely due to this graduate 
program, Konkuk U. is now considered as one of a few universities leading interdisciplinary research and education.</p>

In 2008, based on the Department of Advanced Technology Fusion, Konkuk U. founded a research institute focused on information 
technology-based interdisciplinary research: the Institute for Ubiquitous Information Technology and Applications (UBITA). 
UBITA has been doing large-scale interdisciplinary research projects.</p>

Through activities with the Biosciences WG, Konkuk U. and KISTI have jointly developed a grid computing system for molecular 
simulation called MGrid which is considered one of the few successful grid computing projects in Korea. The system is now 
available in the Korea shared supercomputing infrastructure called PLSI. PLSI consists of twelve high performance computing 
centers in Korea and currently provides three computing services; MGrid is one of these services.</p>

In 2011, an interdisciplinary research collaboration network for ecology, meteorology, and information technology, 
the Korea Ecological Observation Network (KEON) was founded in Korea. KEON consists of government and university research 
institutes, as well as individual members in Korea. UBITA is one of the founding institute members. The vision and organization 
of KEON is largely inspired by PRAGMA and the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON). GLEON is a grassroots 
organization of more than 300 members that draws its origins to the NCHC Ecogrid projects. One specific component of 
KEON is the Korean Lake Ecological Observatory Network (KLEON, see next story).</p>

For the last decade, PRAGMA has given Konkuk U. opportunities for global collaboration with excellent research groups in the world. 
Due to such opportunities, Konkuk U. has become one of the leading institutes in interdisciplinary education and research in Korea.</p>
