<p>The University of Hyderabad (UoHyd) is a founding member of PRAGMA and an initial member of the PRAGMA Steering Committee. PRAGMA serves as a mechanism through which information and resources can easily be exchanged. It is playing the catalytic role of promoting collaborations. We found that with its participative sessions, PRAGMA encourages people to connect with each other quickly and seamlessly. Networking is easier and fruitful partnerships are being initiated in a relatively short time. PRAGMA has a focus and a mission to accomplish tasks and test new ideas.
Recent efforts of UoHyd have centered on exchanging students under the PRIME program, which provides undergraduates at UCSD with hands-on, full-time research experiences in internationally collaborative settings. Several of our own students have benefitted by interacting with them. This has helped us to evolve a very vibrant academic and research group here in our department (Computer/Information Sciences) where every year several students register to work on problems related to grid and cloud computing.
PRAGMA has been providing a great opportunity to connect to the grid research community and landscape of cultures as it moves from one location to another.
