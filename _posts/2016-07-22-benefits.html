  <h4>University of Hyderabad (UoHyd)</h4>

<p>The University of Hyderabad (UoHyd) is a founding member of PRAGMA and an initial member of the PRAGMA Steering Committee. 
PRAGMA serves as a mechanism through which information and resources can easily be exchanged. It is playing the catalytic role of 
promoting collaborations. We found that with its participative sessions, PRAGMA encourages people to connect with each other quickly 
and seamlessly. Networking is easier and fruitful partnerships are being initiated in a relatively short time. PRAGMA has a focus and 
a mission to accomplish tasks and test new ideas.
Recent efforts of UoHyd have centered on exchanging students under the PRIME program, which provides undergraduates at UCSD 
with hands-on, full-time research experiences in internationally collaborative settings. Several of our own students have 
benefitted by interacting with them. This has helped us to evolve a very vibrant academic and research group here in our 
department (Computer/Information Sciences) where every year several students register to work on problems related to grid and 
cloud computing. PRAGMA has been providing a great opportunity to connect to the grid research community and landscape of 
cultures as it moves from one location to another.

  <h4>National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)</h4>

<p>The National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC) is a statutory government organization under the National 
Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA), Ministry of Science and Technology. Our main responsibilities are to undertake, 
support, and promote the development of electronics and computer technologies through research and development activities. 
The range of our applications spans from supporting agriculture, healthcare, ecology and environment, manufacturing and the 
service industry, to bridging the digital divide, cultural preservation, disaster mitigation, and development of R&D human resource. 
We also play role in the development of IT related research infrastructure.</p>

NECTEC has been an active member of PRAGMA since 2002. We have found that the collaboration with PRAGMA is very beneficial 
to our missions. Close relationships with the Resource Working Group have given us good technical support for our computing 
resource setup. This has been one of our strengths in building the computing infrastructure for computational research in Thailand. 
Collaborations within PRAGMA led us to become a member of APGrid PMA, which became a significant component in our development of 
the Thailand National e-Science Infrastructure Consortium. Our development of an environmental information portal called “Environment 
Informatorium” has become part of a GEO Grid collaboration. This is a result of the interaction within the GEO Working Group. 
Participation in PRAGMA’s Telescience Working Group has led to recent collaborations on coral reef monitoring with the Australian 
Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), NCHC, NECTEC, Walailak University (WU), and UCSD. Researchers from collaborating partners and 
a student from PRIME have visited the study site at Racha Island, Southern Thailand; Michael Nekrasov, PRIME 2009, returned there 
to help with setting up the site. The equipment and software system have been set up and the site has already been registered as 
the fourth CREON coral reef site. A paper on this will be presented by the lead author, Professor Mullica of WU at the upcoming 
Environmental Information Management (EIM) conference.*</p>
