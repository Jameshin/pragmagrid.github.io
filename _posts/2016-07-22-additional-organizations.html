title: "Additional Organizations Active in PRAGMA"
---

<p><a href="http://biodiversity.ku.edu" target="_blank">BIODIVERSITY INSTITUTE, UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS</a>, and its researchers and students
conduct research on seven continents in areas such as biodiversity informatics, systematics and ecology and evolutionary biology. They have
contributed to the biodiversity expedition through participation in workshops and in the use and extension of the Lifemapper software.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.narl.org.tw/en" target="_blank">NATIONAL APPLIED RESEARCH LABORATORIES (NARL)</a> was established in 2003 to
consolidate nine national laboratories into a single nonprofit organization to construct, operate, and maintain the large-scale R&amp;D facility and
platform in support of academic research and foster the necessary manpower in various advanced fields focused by the nation. NCHC is one of the
laboratories in NARL. NARL can bring to bear several other laboratories at NARL for PRAGMA collaborations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nict.go.jp" target="_blank">NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (NICT)</a>, is an
incorporated administrative agency that conducts general research and development on information technology supporting
  the ubiquitous society of the future. NICT supported students in the PRIME program 2009-2015 and has participated in the 
  activities of the Telescience Working Group through support of the high-definition video conferencing testing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.up.edu.au" target="_blank">UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND (UQ)</a>, has recently become involved in PRAGMA thorugh David Abramson's
  move there.  David remains actively involved in PRAGMA (see MURPA section).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vt.edu" target="_blank">VIRGINIA TECH</a> Cayelan Carey and colleagues in Project EDDIE (Environmental
  Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration; projecteddie.org, an NSF-funded project) have developed sensor-based
  and time series data analysis activities that can be integrated into classrooms to improve quantitative skills, reasoning, and
  increase student engagement.  Prof. Carey has expanded upon this effort by developing additional 
  open-source teaching materials that use the overlay network developed as part of PRAGMA 
  to run hundreds of lake simulations of climated change scenarios.  Students develop hypotheses about how 
  climate change is affecting lakes, use the overlay network to run climate change experiments in silico, then examine the output 
  to evaluate their hypotheses. To date, more than a hundred undergraduate students have participated in the modeling module 
  across multiple universities.  All teaching materials are publicly available online.  Assessment results demonstrate participation 
  in this curriculum significantly increases students' comprehension about how climate
change affects lakes, as well as students' experience level working with modeling and computing tools.</p>
