  <h4>Hackathon Topics</h4>
</div>

* **Topic 1: <br>[Extension of the existing PRAGMA Cloud Testbed site][1]**
  <br>Possible project:
  * Setting up a node (with or without ENT) and registering the node to the PRAGMA Cloud
    Scheduler. Possibly start a virtual cluster via cloud scheduler. 

* **Topic 2: <br>[Applications that add more visibility and analytical ability to PRAGMA Cloud Testbed services][2]**
  <br>Possible projects:
  * An API for querying the Cloud Scheduler database for registered sites and new
    real-time visualizations of the results for PRAGMA Testbed sites.
  * New visualization that monitors current bookings (running virtual clusters),
    on what sites, and what is remaining site availability. Possibly name of a virtual cluster.

* **Topic 3: <br>[Applications that search, query, discover or generally mine
  biodiversity data through Lifemapper APIs][3]**
  <br>Possible projects:
  * New visualizations to summarize the contents of a Lifemapper datastore
    (archive) by species and time. The visualization will display the contents
    (species) and computation status (initialized, computed, error) of species
    archive. The search API allows aggregations and statistics to be searched
    and retrieved efficiently, which could be displayed in graphs, trees, maps,
    videos or any other visual method.     
  * New visualizations to provide related information to decide if new compute
    nodes  are needed to calculate jobs for a Lifemapper Server instance. This
    visualization will query the archive to determine the speed of species
    additions, and job creation, in relationship to the speed of job
    computations.  The search API allows aggregations and statistics to be
    computed efficiently, which could be displayed in graphs, trees, maps,
    videos or any other visual method.
