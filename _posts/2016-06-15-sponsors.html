PRAGMA is supported by its member institutions and the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF OCI 1234983, PI: Papadopoulos), 
involving researchers at UCSD, U Florida, Indiana U, and U Wisconsin.  It involves support from NSF Office of Cyberinfrastructure, 
Office of International Science and Engineering, Division of Information and Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for 
Computer and Information Science and Engineering, and the Emerging Frontiers Office of the Directorate for Biological Science.  
Its funding provides partial support for involvement of Indiana University, University of Florida and University of Wisconsin 
researchers. In addition, previous support came from NSF OCI-0627026, PI: Papadopoulos, and involved support from NSF's Office
of Shared Cyberinfrastructure, Office of International Science and Engineering, Division of Information and Intelligent Systems, 
and Division of Biological Infrastructure. A reallocation of funds has engaged researchers at the University of Kansas for the 
Virtual Biodiversity Expedition, and a recent NSF-funded supplement has been able to engage researchers at Virginia Tech for 
development and dissemination of tools developed by the Lake Expedition.
