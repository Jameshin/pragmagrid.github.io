Dear PRAGMA friends,

The workshop is co-located with the [eResearch Australasia conference, 2017](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/). 
PRAGMA will have a booth at the conference during October 18-20, 2017. 

PRAGMA attendees who are submitting poster, demo or talk can also 
present their work at the booth.  The demo can be about your PRAGMA activities
or about your Research organization activities. We are happy to exhibit 
any research-related printed material that you can provide (brochures,
posters).

Each session will be about 1.5 hr long  and will be time-slot-aligned with e-Research 
presentations so nobody will need to stay in the booth  for the whole duration
but will only need to be in the booth during some of these 5 sessions.  
**The demos are "on demand"** so nobody will be
at the booth for an extended time
and will have a chance to attend other eResearch activities. 

Depending on the number of submissions and respective presenters time
availability, we will make a schedule for the booth demos.  Current proposed
schedule:
