  <h4>Hackathon Topic 3: Applications that search, query, discover or
  generally mine biodiversity data through Lifemapper APIs 
  </h4>
</div>

**Possible projects**: 

* New visualizations to summarize the contents of a Lifemapper datastore
  (archive) by species and time. The visualization will display the contents
  (species) and computation status (initialized, computed, error) of species
  archive. The search API allows aggregations and statistics to be searched
  and retrieved efficiently, which could be displayed in graphs, trees, maps,
  videos or any other visual method.
  
* New visualizations to provide related information to decide if new compute
  nodes are needed to calculate jobs for a Lifemapper Server instance. This
  visualization will query the archive to determine the speed of species
  additions, and job creation, in relationship to the speed of job
  computations. The search API allows aggregations and statistics to be
  computed efficiently, which could be displayed in graphs, trees, maps,
  videos or any other visual method.
