<h4>Monash Undergraduate Research Projects Abroad (MURPA) — International Research Internships at the University of Queensland and Monash University</h4>
</div>

<p>

In today’s educational arena, universities must provide students with opportunities to work and study abroad to prepare them for global citizenship and professional competence in a multi-cultural workplace. Numerous reports have challenged universities to develop educational programs that provide an integrated academic basis for developing students’ cultural/global competencies. 

Since 2008, 42 Monash University students have travelled to international partners under the Monash Undergraduate Research Projects Abroad program (MURPA). They are selected for the program the year prior to their research internships, hence, those chosen in 2015 travelled in 2016, etc.  They have travelled to the University of California, San Diego, the National Center for Supercomputing Research in Illinois, The Technion in Israel, the Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) in Singapore and the University of Warwick. Students are placed for a period of 8 weeks, allowing them to integrate into the research groups as team members. Students have a local mentor in Australia as well as one in the remote site, and often bridge international research projects. 

To date, UC San Diego has hosted 30 MURPA students.  They are as follows:

MURPA and QURPA involve an advanced seminar scheme, in which students can attend virtual seminars given by world leading experts before they leave. These seminars also allow students to "meet" potential UCSD mentors and get some information about potential projects. In 2016 the seminar series focused on an all female cast of presenters. At the time of writing this report, six students  have been selected at Monash for the upcoming MURPA 2016/2017 round, and two UQ students are yet to be chosen.

Seminars were sourced from UCSD, Intel, University of Delaware, the University of Notre Dame, the University of Southern California, the University of Chicago, the University of Colorado Boulder, Brown University, the University of Tennessee, the University of Utah, SDSC. As done in the past, seminars were broadcast simultaneously to Monash (in Melbourne) and UQ (in Brisbane), with audiences able to ask questions from either venue. The seminar infrastructure supports a wide range of video conference technologies (both open source and commercial), and is displayed on a 20 MPixel OptiPortal.
