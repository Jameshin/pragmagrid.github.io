  * allows complete freedom to access and configure network resources.
  
<p></p>

* Provide access of SDN hardware/software to PRAGMA researchers.

* Offer networking support for PRAGMA multi-cloud and user-defined trust envelopes.

* Create and utilize an experimental software-defined Network Testbed.

See [technical documentation][1] in the PRAGMA-ENT public repository.
