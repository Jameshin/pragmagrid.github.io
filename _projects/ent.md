### PRAGMA Experimental Network Testbed (PRAGMA-ENT) 

#### Goals:

* Build breakable international SDN testbed for use by PRAGMA researchers that:

  * is not a production system;
  * allows complete freedom to access and configure network resources.

* Provide access of SDN hardware/software to PRAGMA researchers.

* Offer networking support for PRAGMA multi-cloud
  and user-defined trust envelopes.

See [technical documentation][1] in the PRAGMA-ENT public repository.
