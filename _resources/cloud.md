The PRAGMA Cloud started in 2010 by Resources Working Group. PRAGMA Cloud is
composed of VM hosting systems and technical expertise from PRAGMA members and
friends institutions. It provides the infrastructure and a collaborative
environment for Cloud software and applications to interoperate and improve.
It is also where PRAGMA researchers can innovate and experiment with new
approaches and new solutions to make Cloud easy to use.
