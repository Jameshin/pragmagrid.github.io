In 2010 the Resources Working Group started PRAGMA Cloud. Composed of VM hosting systems and technical expertise from PRAGMA members and
collaborating institutions, PRAGMA Cloud provides the infrastructure and a collaborative
environment for Cloud software and applications.
PRAGMA researchers can experiment and develop innovative ideas and 
approaches to find effective solutions improving the ability to obtain access for Cloud resources. For additional
