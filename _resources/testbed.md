### The Persistent PRAGMA Testbed Resources

**To add a new site to a PRAGMA Cloud testbed follow [this link]:[2]**

How do we make a worldwide collection of resources available and usable
for sharing of data/computation?

* Various technologies are now "good" enough to try:
  * PRAGMA Boot 
  * Cloud Controller 
  * Overlay Networks
  
  <p>

* Two types of natural testbed resources
  * Pure Virtual Machine (VM)  and Virtual Cluster (VC) hosting
  * VM and VC hosting with programmable networking 
    see [ENT][1]
<p>
* Drive infrastructure by meeds of specific use cases: 
  * Biodiversity Expedition
  * Lake Ecology Expedition
  * Experimental Network Testbed
  * Needs of other PRAGMA working groups
  
<p>

#### Cloud deployment technologies 

* ROCKS (UCSD)
* OpenStack (NCHC)
* OPenNebula (NCHC)
* CloudStack (AIST, UFL, KU)

<p>

#### Record keeping performance 

* perfSONAR - mesh configuration

<p>

#### Sites

* UCSD
* UFL
* AIST
* NAIST
* Internet2
* CNIC
* Osaka
* NCHC
* IU
