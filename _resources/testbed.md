### The Persistent PRAGMA Testbed Resources

**To add a new site to a PRAGMA Cloud testbed follow [this link][2]**

How do we make a worldwide collection of resources available and usable
for sharing of data/computation?

* Various technologies are now "good" enough to try:
  * PRAGMA Boot 
  * Cloud Controller 
  * Overlay Networks 

<br/>

* Two types of natural testbed resources:
  * Pure Virtual Machine (VM) and Virtual Cluster (VC) hosting
  * VM and VC hosting with programmable networking 
    see [ENT][1]

<br/>

* Drive infrastructure by needs of specific use cases: 
  * Biodiversity Expedition
  * Lake Ecology Expedition
  * Experimental Network Testbed
  * Needs of other PRAGMA working groups

<br/>

#### Cloud deployment technologies 

* ROCKS (UCSD)
* OpenStack (NCHC)
* OPenNebula (NCHC)
* CloudStack (AIST, UFL, KU)

<br/>

#### Record keeping performance 

* perfSONAR - mesh configuration

<br/>

#### Sites

* UF
* UCSD
* IU
* NAIST
* Osaka
* AIST
* NCHC
* Thammasat
* MIMOS
* Kasaesart (currently, its reousrces ar enot connected to ENT)
