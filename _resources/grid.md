#### PRAGMA Grid 

The PRAGMA Grid is established May 18, 2004 by PRAGMA Resources Working Group.
This grid is composed of cluster systems and technical expertise from PRAGMA
members and friends institutions. It provides the infrastructure and a
collaborative environment for grid middleware and grid applications to
interoperate and improve. It is  also where PRAGMA researchers can innovate and
experiment with new approaches and new solutions to make the grid easy to use.
Please see more detail information on PRAGMA Grid resources.

#### Who should join PRAGMA grid?

Any institutions have been working in grid applications and middleware and are
interested in building a long term collaborative relationship with PRAGMA
communities are welcome to join PRAGMA grid.

Any individual researchers interested in working with PRAGMA grid can work
thru their home institutions or thru existing PRAGMA grid member institutions
which they already have working relationship with.

PRAGMA grid does not require every member institution to contribute hardware
resources, but for all practical purposes, it's a lot easier for application
drivers to access PRAGMA grid from a local node that's a part of PRAGMA grid.

#### What kinds of applications are suitable to run in PRAGMA Grid?

- Real science and real grid applications - per PRAGMA charter.
- Applications can submit jobs through globus gatekeeper to local job
   schedulers (SGE, PBS, LSF, SQMS, etc.).  This enables resource sharing in PRAGMA grid.
- No absolute rules, and things may change as better technologies
   develop. In case of any questions on the suitability of your application,
   contact PRAGMA Cloud Admin.
