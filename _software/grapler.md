GRAPLEr is a distributed computing system that integrates and applies overlay
virtual network, high-throughput computing, and Web service technologies.
GRAPLEr allows submission of hundreds or thousands of General Lake Model (GLM)
simulations, runs these lake model simulations efficiently, and retrieves
model output. GRAPLEr image includes a new R package developed as part of the
lake expedition. 

Virtual Images of GRAPLEr are available from [PRAGMA Boot
Google Drive Virtual Cluster Image repository][1].
