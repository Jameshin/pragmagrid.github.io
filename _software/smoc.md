Smoc (Simple Multipath OpenFlow Controller) is an OpenFlow controller that can
handle and distribute subflows of a Multipath TCP (MPTCP) session. By
distributing subflows of a MPTCP into different paths, it can improve the
network performance. It was evaluated on PRAGMA-ENT resources. Smoc is
developed by Chawanat Nakasan at NAIST (Japan) and evaluated in a local
virtual environment and in a PRAGMA ENT environment.
