PRAGMA Cloud Scheduler is a web interface that enables users to create and run
virtual clusters at the different PRAGMA sites. The first version was based on
an open source scheduler developed by [Twinkle Toes Software][1].

The second version included a new modular Web-based interface 
rewritten anew as a senior project by Thammasat University computer science students,
Nannapas Banluesombatkul, Prapansak Kaewlamul, This new version provides a
much more intuitive user interface for viewing and searching the available
resources and making virtual cluster reservations.
