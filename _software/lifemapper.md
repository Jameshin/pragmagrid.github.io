A software toolkit, now includes tools for installing and
configuring Lifemapper third party dependencies, configuration and
installation for local hardware, and bootstrapping the database with default
or user data. PRAGMA GitHub repositories contain code for installation
of the two primary components of the Lifemapper, a server and a compute
component. These components may be installed on the same or distributed
compute infrastructures. 

Currently, we distribute rocks cluster images for the Lifemapper installation
from ISO due to varying data sets used for the Lifemapper installation.
