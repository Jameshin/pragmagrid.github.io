Overseer is an OpenFlow controller which implements application-aware routing.
Unlike conventional routing mechanisms, application-aware routing allows to
deploy optimal routing paths for each application. Pongsakorn U-chupala at the
Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) in Japan developed the
controller. The controller was evaluated on PRAGMA-ENT resources and it was
very helpful to use the product in a real practical environment as well as in
a local virtual environment.
