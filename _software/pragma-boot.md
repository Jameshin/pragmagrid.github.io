PRAGMA boot is an extensible framework to enable deployment of Virtual
Clusters on different PRAGMA cloud infrastructures. Currently, KVM and
CloudStack virtualization engines are supported. PRAGMA boot can start
instances from the local images on the disk or can download images from a
trusted repository.
