Opimon is a visualization tool which can monitor and visualize an OpenFlow
network. Opimon provides the topology graph of the OpenFlow network and also
shows flow table information of each OpenFlow switch. This software is used
for visualizing PRAGMA-ENT environment. Opimon is developed by Wassapon
Putchong's student in Kasetsart University (Thailand). He demonstrated the
visualization tool at PRAGMA 31 meeting in Bangkok. The tool is really helpful
to operate an international SDN-testbed like ENT.
