ViNe implements routing and other communication mechanisms needed to deploy,
operate, and manage user-level software-defined IP overlay networks. The ViNe
approach to overlay networks is described in the [poster][1].
In PRAGMA-ENT, ViNe overlays were temporarily used to expand PRAGMA-ENT to
sites without direct connection to the ENT backbone.
